BAGGINSES: Return of the Bag.

Bag sizes are the same:

Tier		Height	Width		Slots
1			3		5			15
2			3		9			27
3			4		9			36

Bags:
	16 colours of bags in 3 tiers. No change there
	Ender bag: no changes
	Void bag: no changes

Magnet:
	Craftable item that can be added to bags in order to "attract" dropped items toward the bags
	Same as magnet mode works currently.
	Unsure yet on how to add this to bags, whether I do it as a recipe [Bag + Magnet] or with a slot inside where it is added

Filter:
	Craftable item added to bags in order to filter which items are whitelisted/blacklisted by the Magnet on the bag
	[ores going into bag 1, gems into bag 2, cobble and crap voided to bag 3, etc.]

Soulbound:
	Same as currently done
